# Connect 4

    Description
    - A game based on "tic tac toe" where the goal is to make a line of 4 to win the game. The app is a "chat application bot" where we use commands to initiate a prompt for a game to commence, and since it's chat based this can also benefit on the fact that you create a team to play a game of Connect4. We made a twist to the traditional 1v1 style of Connect4 to a more team based game where you communicate with your team to think on where you want to place a coin. 

    Commands
    /start - Starts a Connect4 Game
    /join - Join a Connect4 Game
    /reset - Restart the Game
    /rules - A slash command made to display the rules of the Game
